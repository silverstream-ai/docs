## What is Bench?

Bench is a debugging tool for AI agents. It captures synchronized video, DOM snapshots, and execution traces so you can see exactly what your agent saw when it failed.

## Why Bench?

When an agent fails, you're left guessing:
- What did it see?
- What did it click?
- Why did it choose that action?

Bench gives you **visual replay** of every agent run, synced with the execution trace. No more guessing.
