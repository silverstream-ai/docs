description: "Add Bench to your agent in under 5 minutes"
---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- An AI agent using Playwright, Selenium, or browser automation
- A Bench API key ([get one here](https://landing.silverstream.ai))

## Install

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install bench-sdk
```

```bash poetry
poetry add bench-sdk
```

```bash uv
uv add bench-sdk
```
</CodeGroup>

## Basic Integration

### Option 1: Context Manager (Recommended)

The simplest way to record agent runs:

```python
from bench import Bench

bench = Bench(api_key="your-api-key")

with bench.record():
    # Your agent code here
    agent.run(task)
```

Every action your agent takes inside the `with` block is recorded.

### Option 2: Decorator

For function-based agents:

```python
from bench import Bench

bench = Bench(api_key="your-api-key")

@bench.trace
def run_agent(task):
    agent.run(task)
    return result

run_agent("Book a flight to NYC")
```

### Option 3: Manual Start/Stop

For more control:

```python
from bench import Bench

bench = Bench(api_key="your-api-key")

session = bench.start_recording()
try:
    agent.run(task)
finally:
    session.stop()
```

## View Your Recording

After your agent completes:

1. Open the [Bench Dashboard](https://app.silverstream.ai)
2. Find your run in the list
3. Click to open the visual replay

You'll see:
- **Video replay** of what your agent saw
- **DOM snapshots** at each step
- **Action timeline** showing clicks, typing, and navigation
- **LLM trace** showing model decisions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Playwright">
    ```python
    from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
    from bench import Bench

    bench = Bench(api_key="your-api-key")

    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch()
        page = browser.new_page()

        with bench.record(page=page):
            # Your Playwright automation
            page.goto("https://example.com")
            page.click("button")
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Selenium">
    ```python
    from selenium import webdriver
    from bench import Bench

    bench = Bench(api_key="your-api-key")
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()

    with bench.record(driver=driver):
        driver.get("https://example.com")
        driver.find_element("button").click()
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Browser Use">
    ```python
    from browser_use import Agent
    from bench import Bench

    bench = Bench(api_key="your-api-key")

    agent = Agent(task="Find flights to NYC")

    with bench.record():
        result = await agent.run()
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Environment Variables

Instead of passing the API key directly:

```bash
export BENCH_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

```python
from bench import Bench

bench = Bench()  # Reads from BENCH_API_KEY
```

## What Gets Recorded?

| Data | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Screenshots | Frame-by-frame capture of the browser |
| DOM | HTML structure at each action |
| Actions | Clicks, typing, scrolling, navigation |
| Network | API calls and responses |
| Console | Browser console logs and errors |
| LLM Calls | Model inputs/outputs via OpenTelemetry |

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Recording not appearing in dashboard">
    - Verify your API key is correct
    - Check that `bench.record()` completed without errors
    - Ensure you have network connectivity to `api.silverstream.ai`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing screenshots">
    - Pass the `page` or `driver` object explicitly
    - Check browser is not running headless without screenshot support
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Import errors">
    - Ensure `bench-sdk` is installed: `pip show bench-sdk`
    - Check Python version is 3.9+
  </Accordion>
